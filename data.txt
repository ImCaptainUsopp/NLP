tom loves to fish
every weekend Tom goes to the lake to fish
he brings a fishing rod and a can of worms
tom hopes to catch a big fish
sometimes Tom catches a small fish
after fishing Tom cans the fish he catches
tom likes to can fish because it keeps the fish fresh
mary also likes to fish
mary and Tom can fish together
they fish at the lake and bring cans for the fish they catch
